# Password Generator Starter Code

## Purpose

For this project we are completing a Password Generator file. The intended function of the application will generate an 8-12 character password that contains Upper and Lower case letters, numbers, and special characters. The function of the application will be started by a simple button click.

## Guide

Before you click! Just add any parameters you see fit to add to the security of the password generator.

Choose a password Length!

Then add or subtract the types of characters (letters, uppercase, lowercase, or symbols) you want to add. 

Press submit and BOOM! The last password you'll need... until you forget it.
